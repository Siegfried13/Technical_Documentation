      <p>CA Business Intelligence JasperReports Server 7.1.1 provides installation through three different options as listed. Upgrade from previous <code>6x versions of CA Business Intelligence </code> is also supported through GUI and silent installation only. The following types of installation are as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>GUI Installation</p>
This installation method is supported for new installations only and on the OS types and versions presented in the chart. In addition to presenting an intuitive GUI-based install experience, this method provides the option to install bundled versions of Apache Tomcat and a database (PostgreSQL), components required by CA Business Intelligence. While the GUI installer bundles particular versions of Apache Tomcat and PostgreSQL, it is also flexible in its allowance for reference an existing preferred database (Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL) or an existing preferred version of Tomcat (version 8).
 Silent InstallationThe response file based installation provides a way to record or capture GUI-based installation selections into a file that can be referenced later for future silent or unattended installations.</li>
        <li><p> Ant-based Installation</p>
The silent installation is accomplished through executing a script that references a .properties file containing all necessary information that is required to install CA Business Intelligence (ex. Tomcat location, database connection info, etc.). The .properties file is configured by the enduser. As opposed to the GUI installer, you must provide an existing installed Apache Tomcat instance and an existing supported database. Refer to the prerequisites section for more information about preparing for a silent installation.</li>
      </ul>

    <p>Prerequisites</p>

Verify Upgrade</p>
 
<p>Prerequisites</p>
<p>Back up your Jasperserver database:</p>
    <ul>
<li>Create a folder where you can save your jasperserver database
For example, C:\JS_BACKUP or /opt/JS_BACKUP</li>
<li>Run the following commands for PostgreSQL:
<code>PostgreSQL:
cd <path>/JS_BACKUP
pg_dump --username=postgres jasperserver > js-db-dump.sql</code> </li>
<li>Back up your JasperReports server war file:
Create a folder where you can save your jasperserver-pro folder.
For example,<code> C:\JS_BACKUP or /opt/JS_BACKUP
Copy <tomcat>/webapps/jasperserver-pro to <path>/JS_BACKUP </code></li>
<li>If you made modifications to the existing JasperReports Server application, you need to manually back up and restore configuration changes, like client-specific security classes or LDAP server configurations in your existing environment and integrate them with your upgraded environment.</li>
<li>Ensure that Tomcat directory is closed before you upgrade CABI to avoid errors while upgrading.
(Windows) Ensure that you review JasperReports known issues and update the timeout settings in jasperreports.properties file as needed to avoid timeout issues and upgrade errors.</li>
  </ul>
